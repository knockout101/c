Pointers and Strings

- One of the most common applications of using a pointer to an array is as a pointer to a character string
    - the reasons are one of the notational convenience and efficiency
    - using a variable of type pointer to char to reference a string give you a lot of flexibility

- if you have an array of character called text, you could similarly define a pointer to be used to point to elements in text

char *textPtr;

- if textPtr is set pointing to the beginning of an array of chars called text

++textPtr;

- the above sets textPtr pointing to the next character in text, which is text[1]

--textPtr;

- the above sets textPtr pointing to the previous character in text, assuming that textPtr was not pointing to the beginning of text prior to the execution of this statement

void copyString(char *to, char *from)
{
    while (*from)
        *to++ = *from++;

    *to = '\0';
}

int main(void)
{
    char string1[] = "A string to be copied.";
    char string2[50];
    
    copyString(string2, string1);
    printf("%s\n", string2);
}
