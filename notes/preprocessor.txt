- Unique C feature not found in many other higher-level languages
- allows for programs to be easier to develop, easier to read, easier to modify, and easier to port to different computer systems

- Part of the C compilation process that recognizes special statements
    - analyzes these statements before analysis of the c program itself takes place
    - an instruction to your compiler to do something before compiling the source code
    - could be anywhere in your code

- Proprocessor statements are indentified by the presence of a pound sign # which must be the first non-space character on the line
- out first "challenge" used a preprocessor directive, specifically the #include directive

- We will utilize the preprocessor to:
    - create our own constants and macros with the #define statement
    - build your own library files with the #include statement
    - make more powerful programs with the conditional #ifdef, #endif, #else and #ifndef Statements


#include <stdio.h>

".h" refers to the extension of the file and it is describing a "header file"

- Header Files
    - header files define information about some of the functions that are provided by that file
        - stdio.h is the standard C library header and provides functionality for displaying output, among many other things
        - we need to include this file in a program when using the printf() function from the standard library
        - stdio.h contains the information that the compiler needs to understand what printf() means, as well as other functions that deal with input and output
        - stdio is short for standard input/output
    - header files specify information that the compiler uses to integrate any predefined functions within a program 
    - You will be creating your own header fiels for use with your programs

    - case sensitive on some systems, so you should always write them in lowercase
    - two ways to #include header files in a program
        - using angle brackets (#include <test.h>)
            - telling the preprocessor to look for the file in one or more standard system direcrtories
        - using double quotes (#include "test.h")
            - telling the preprocessor to first look in the current directory
