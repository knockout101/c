Basic data types in C are:
    - int
    - float
    - double
    - char
    - _Bool

- The difference between the types is in the amount of memory they occupy and the range of values they can hold
    - the amount of storage that is allocated to store a particular type of data
    - depends on the computer you are running (machine-dependent)
    - an integer might take up 32 bits on your computer, or perhaps it might be stored in 64 bits

- int is a signed integer and it can store hexadecimal notation

- float stores decimals

- double is used as a float when float is taking up to little memory to store the value

- C offers three adjective keywards to modify the basic integer type (can also be used by itself)
    - short, long, and unsigned

- the type 'short int' or 'short' may use less storage when only small numbers are needed
