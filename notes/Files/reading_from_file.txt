- the fgetc() function reads a character from a text file that has been opened for reading

- takes a file pointer as its only argument and returns the character read as type int

int mchar = fgetc(pfile);

- the mchar is type int because EOF will be returned if the end of the file has been reached

- the function getc(), which is equivalent to fgetc(), is also available
    - requires an argument of type FILE* and returns the character reaad as type int
    - virtually identical to fgetc()
    - only difference between them is that getc() my be implemented as a macro, whereas fgetc() is a function

- you can read the contents of a file again when necessary
    - the rewind() function positions the file that is specified by the file pointer argument at the beginning

rewind(pfile);

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    FILE *fp;
    int c;

    fp = fopen("file.txt", "r");

    if (fp == NULL)
    {
        perror("Error in opening file");
        return (-1);
    }

    while ((c = fgetc(fp)) != EOF)
        printf(%c, c);
    
    fclose(fp);
    fp = NULL;
    return 0;
