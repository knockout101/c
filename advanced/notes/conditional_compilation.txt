- C preprocessor offers a feature known as conditional compilation 
    - often used to create one program that can be compiled to run on different computer systems 

- if you had a large program that had many dependencies on specific hardware or software
    - you might end up with many defines those values would have to be changed when the program was moved to another computer system 
    - you can help reduce this problem by incorporating the values of these defines for each different machine into the program by using the conditional compilation capabilities of the preprocessor 

- it is also used to switch on and off various statements in the program 
    - debugging statements that print out the values of various variables 
    - trace the flow of program execution 

- conditional compilation enables you to control the execution of preprocessor directives and the compilation of program code 
    - each of the conditional preprocessor directives evaluates an indentifier or a constant integer expression 
        - cast expressions, sizeof expressions and enumeration constants cannot be evaluated in preprocessor directives

- includes a set of commands that tell the compiler to accept or ignore blocks of information or code according to conditions at the time of compilation 

- conditional preprocessor construct is much like the if selection statement 

- every #if constuct ends with an #endif 

- directives #ifdef and #ifndef are provided as shorthand for
    - #if defined(name)
    - #if !defined(name)

- multiple-part conditional preprocessor constructs may be tested with directives #elif and #else 

- this directive checks whether an identifier is currently defined 
    - identifiers can be defined by a #define directive or on the command line 

- to set an identifier

#define UNIX 1 OR #define UNIX 

- most compilers also permit you to define a name to the preprocessor when the program is compiled 
    - use the special option -D to the compiler command 

gcc -D UNIX program.c 

the general form of the #ifdef directive is 

#ifdef identifier 

- identifiers cannot be any keywords or enumeration constants 

- if the identifier specified has been defined by the preprocessor 
    - compile all the code up to the next #else or #endif, whichever comes first 
    - if there is an #else, all code from the #else to the #endif is compiled if the identifier is not defined 

- the #endif directive ends the scope of the #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, or #elif directives 

- the #endif directive has the following syntax 

#endif newline
