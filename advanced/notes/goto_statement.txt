Goto statement

- statement causes program control to jump to a particular line of code in your program
    - this branch is made immediately adn unconditionally upon execution of the goto 

- a label is a name that is formed with the same rules as variable names

- the label is placed directly before the statement to which the branch is to be made adn must appear in the same function as the goto 

- goto and label 

Form:

goto label; // ends in semicolon
.
.
.
label : statement; // must have a semicolon after the label name

- programmers who are lazy freqently abuse the goto statement to branch to other portions of their code

- the goto statement interrupts the normal sequential flow of a program 
    - as a result, programs are harder to follow and thus harder to maintain

- using many gotos in a program can make it impossible to decipher 

- this is why goto statements are not considered part of good programming style

- in principle, you never need to use the goto statement in a C program, however, some programmers develop bad habits 
    - or have learned programming languages where a goto was necessary, i.e. fortran
