Passing Arguments to Threads

- the pthread_create() function permits the programmer to pass one argument to the thread start routine

- when passing more than one argument, you can create a structure which contains all of the arguments, and then pass a pointer to that structure in the pthread_create()

- all arguments must be cast to (void*)
