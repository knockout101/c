Organizing Large Programs

- Divide problem into multiple sub problems

- modulization

- Allows abstraction and re-usability of code 

- files contain all functions from a related group

- when changes are made to a file, only that file need be re-compiled to rebuild the program

- if you check any Open-Source project you can see how large the program is "decentralized" into many numbers of sub-modules
    - each sub-module contributes to a specific critical function of the program
