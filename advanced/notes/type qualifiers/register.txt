Register 

- a processor register (CPU register) is one of a small set of data holding places that are part of the computer processor
    - a register may hold an instruction, a storage address, or any kind of data

- the register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM (memory)
    - makes the use of register variables to be much faster than that of the variables stored in memory during the runtime of the program

- the register storage class should only be used for variables that reuqwire quick access
    - the variables which are most frequently used in a C program
    - if a function ises a particular variable heavily

- the keytword register hints to the compiler that a given variable can be put in a register 
    - it is the compiler's choice to put it in a register or not 
    - MIGHT be stored in a reg depends on hardware and implementation restrictions
    - generally, compilers themselves do optimizations and put the variables in register 

- both local variables and formal parameters can be declared as register variables

- this storage class declares register variables which have the same functionality as that of the auto variables 
    - the lifetime of the register variable remains oonly when control is within the block 

- the variable stored in a register has a maximum size equal to the register size 

- you cannot obtain the address of a register variable using pointers
    - & operator cannot be used

- register can only be used inside main, not in global scope
