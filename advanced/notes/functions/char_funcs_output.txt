- putc() enables you to write a single character to a file (or to stdout)
    - takes two arguments 
        - the first argument is the character that is to be written into the file 
        - the second argument is the FILE pointer that indentifies the file from which the character is to be written to 
    - must first call fopen() in write or append mode 

int putc(int char, FILE *fp)

putc('\n', stdout);

OR 

putc('\n', outputFile);

- has the effect of writing a newline character into the file identified by the FILE pointer outputFile
