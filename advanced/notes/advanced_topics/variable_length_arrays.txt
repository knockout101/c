Variable Length Arrays LVA

- once created its size cannot be changed

- the real advantage is being able initiate the array with a variable because its easier to build programs with this kind of abstraction

- if compiler does not support VLA, the symbol __STDC_NO_VLA__ must be defined as 1

- you check for it like this:

#ifdef __STDC_NO_VLA__
    printf("Variable length arrays are not supported.\n");
    exit(1);
#endif

- best to avoid variable length arrays when unnecessary
    - if needed to dynamically allocate and even reallocate storage buffers, you can calways use pointers
