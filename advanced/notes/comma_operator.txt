Comma Operator

- C supports the use of a comma that can be used in expressions as an operator 
    - has the lowest precedence of any C operator 
    - as as a sequence point 

- a binary operator that evaluates its first operand and discards the result
    - then evaluates the second operand and returns this value (and type)
        - because all operators in C produce a value, the value of the comma operator is that of the rightmost expression 

- the comma operator can be used to separate multiple expressions antywhere that a valid C expression can be used

- the comma operator exists because there are times when you do not want to separate expresssions with semicolons

- comma operator can be used to seperate statements but the comma itself can be used just as a seperater and not an operator.
