- bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word

- computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation inlcude
    - low-level device control 
    - error detection 
    - correction algorithms 
    - data compression 
    - encryption algorithms 
    - optimization 

- a bitwise operation operates on one or more binary numbers at the level of their individual bits 
    - used to manipulate values for comparisons and calculations
    - substantially faster than division, several times faster than multiplication, and sometimes significantly faster than addition

- bitwise logical operators

- C offers bitwise logical operators and shift operators 
    - operate on the bits in integer values 

& - binary AND operator copies a bit to the result if it exits in both operands 
| - binary OR operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand 
^ - binary XOR operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both 
~ - binary ones complement operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits 

- they operator on each bit independently of the bit to the left or right 
    - do not confuse them with the regular logical operators (&&, ||, and !) which operate on values

- all of the logical operators listed in the table (with the exception of the ones complement operator ~) are binary operators
    - take two operands

- bit operations can be performed on any type of integer value in C 
    - int, short, long, long long, and signed or unsigned 
    - and on characters, but cannot be performed on floating-point values 

- a bit mask is data that is used for bitwise operations 
    - using a mask, multiple bits in a byte can be set either on, off, or inverted from on to off (or vice versa) in a single bitwise operation 

- one major use of the bitwise AND, &, and the bitwise OR, |, is in operations to test and set individual bits in an integer variable
    - can use individual bits to store data that involve one of two choices

- you could use a single integer variable to store several characteristics of a person
    - store whether the person is male or female with one bit 
    - use three other bits to specify whether the person can speak French, German, or Italian
    - another bit to record whether the person's salary is $50k or more 
    - in just four bits you have a substantial set of data recorded
