Processes

- a process is a program in execution

- a program is a file containing the information of a process 
    - when you start execution of the program, it is loaded into RAM and starts executing

- each process has its own address space and (usually) one thread of control

- you can have multiple processes executing the same program 
    - but each process has its own copy of the program within its own address space and executes it independently of the other copies

- processes are organized hierarchically
    - each process has a parent process which explicitly arranged to create it

- the processes created by a given parent are called its child processes 
    - a child inherits many of its attributes from the parent process

Processes 

- a system call is a request for service that a program makes of the kernel (the brain of the operating system)
    - the service is generally something that only the kernel has the privilege to do
    - sometimes called kernel calls 

- programmers do not noramlly need to be concerned with system calls because there are functions in the
