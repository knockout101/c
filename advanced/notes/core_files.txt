Overview

- a core dump is generated when a program crashes or is terminated abnormally because of segmentation fault
    - possibly division by zero or attempts to access past the end of an array (illegal memory access)

- a segmentation fault is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that "does not belong to you"
    - a piece of code tries to do read and write operation in a read only location in memory or freed block of memory 

- a core dump is also called a memory dump, storage dump or dump 

- a core dump results in the creation of a file 

- this core file contains a snapshot of the contents of the process's memory at the time it terminated 
    - this file is used for debugging purposes (used to assist in diagnosing and fixing errors)

- core dumps allow a user to save a crash for later or off-site analysis, or comparison with other crashes 

- core dumps can be used to capture data freed during dynamic memory allocation and may thus be used to retrieve information from a program that is no longer running 

- a core dump is contained in a file named something similar to "core.<process_id>"
    - created in current working directory 

- on windows which uses Cygwin
    - the dump may not be named core 
    - it will likely be named something like "mybadprog.exe.stackdump"

- your system might be configured to disable the automatic creation of this core file, often due to the large size of these files 
    - to enable writing core files you use the ulimit command 
        - ulimit -c unlimited 
            - may have to type in "bash" to make sure you are in a shell 
                - otherwise command may not be recognized 

- to "view" a core dump you will need a debugger 
    - it will allow you to examine the state of the process 
    - includes listing the stack traces for all the threads of the process 
    - you can also print the values of variables and registers

- analyzing a core file does not work well without debugging information added to the executable (gcc -g)

- we will be using gdb to analyze our core files
