Overview 

- Queue elements are removed only from the head of the queue 
- Queue elements are inserted only at the tail of the queue 

- a queue is referred to as a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure

- two main operations in a queue 
    - enqueue 
    - dequeue 

- enqueue will insert an element into the back of the queue 

- dequeue will remove an element from the front of the queue 

- other operations 
    - isEmpty 
    - isFull
    - peek 
    - poll or offer ( same as dequeue and enqueue)

- some computer ahve only a single processor, so only one user at a time may be serviced 
    - entries for other users are placed in queue 
    - each entry gradually advances to the front of the queue as users are serviced 

- information packets also wait in queues in computer networks 
    - each time a packet arrives at a network node, it must be routed to the next node on the network 
    - the routing node toues one packet at a time 
        - additional packets are enqueued until the router can route them 
    
- basically, when a resource is shared among multiple consumers, queues are often utilized 

Advantages 

- speed 
    - data queues are a fast method of inter-process communication 

    - data queues free up jobs from performing some work 
        - can lead to a better response time and an overall improvement in system performance 

    - data queues serve as the fastest form of asynchronous communication between two different tasks 
        - there is less overhead than with database files and data areas 

- flexibility 
    - queues are flexible, requiring no communications programming 

    - programmer does not need any knowledge of inter-process communication 

    - data queues allow computers to handle mutliple tasks 

    - the queue can remain active when there are no entries and ready to process data entries when necessary 

LinkedList - Implementation 

- array or linked list systems 

- for the single linked list implementation of a queue, we use a pointer to the front of the list (head) and a pointer to the rear of the list (tail)

- the enqueue operation is performed by inserting the element at the rear of the list 

- the dequeue op is performed by deleting the element at the front of the list 

- some drawbacks of this implementation include speed (all the operations take constant time)
    - calls to malloc and free are expensive especially in comparison to the poitner maniuplation routines 
    
Array Implementation 

- keep track of two indices, front and rear 

- two integers named FRONT and REAR are used to keep track of the first and last elements in the queue

- when initializing the queue, we set the value of FRONT and REAR to -1

- on enqueing an element, we increase the value of REAR index and place the new element in the position pointed to by REAR 

- on dequeing an element, we return the value pointed to by FRONT and increase the FRONT index 

- before enqueing, we check if queue is already full 

- before dequeuing, we check if queue is already empty 

- when enqueing the first element, we set the value of FRONT to 0

- when dequeuing the last element, we reset the values of FRONT and REAR to -1 

- the following steps should be taken to enqueue (insert) data into a queue 

step 1 - check if the queue is full 

step 2 - if the queue is full, produce overflow error and exit 

step 3 - if the queue is not full, increment rear pointer to point the next empty space

step 4 - add data element to the queue location, where the rear is pointing 

step 5 - return success
