Overview 

- tree is a nonlinear, two-dimensional data structure with special properties 

- trees whose nodes contain a maximum of two links are called binary trees
    - none, one, or both of which may be NULL

- the root node is the first node in a tree 

- each link in the root node refers to a child 
    - the left child is the first node in the left subtree
    - the right child is the first node in the right subtree 

- the children of a node are called siblings 

- a node with no children is called a leaf node 

- often used in search, game logic, autocomplete tasks, and graphics

- the most common use of a binary tree is a binary search tree 
    - used in many search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving 
    - map and set objects in many libraries

- binary space partition algorithm
    - used in almost every 3D video game to determine what objects need to be rendered 

- used in many high bandwidth routers for storing router-tables

- different forms of binary trees are used by compilers to parse expressions 

- data compression algorithms 

- database problems like indexing 

Binary Search Tree 

- a binary search tree is a linked structure that incorporates the binary search algorithm 
    - an ordered data structure 
    - allows for fast lookup, addition and removal of items 

- a fundemental data structure used to construct more abstract data structures such as sets, multisets, and associative arrays 

- a binary search tree has the following properties 
    - values in any left subtree are less than the value in its parent node 
    - values in any right subtree are greater than the value in its parent node 

- is considered balanced if every level of the tree is fully filled with the exception of the last level 
    - on the last level, the tree is filled left to right 

- a perfect BST is one in which it is both full and complete 
    - all child nodes are on the same level and each node has a left and a right child node 

- a binary search tree has no duplicate node values 
    - an attempt to insert a duplicate value will be recognized when creating the tree 
        - a duplicate will follow the same "go left" or "go right" decisions on each comparison as the original value did 
        - the duplicate will eventually be compared with a node in the tree containing the same value 
            - duplicate value is discarded at this point 

- a node can only be inserted as a leaf node 

- if the tree is tightly packed, each level contains about twice as many elements as the previous level 

- suppose you want to find an item (target)
    - if the item precedes the root item, you need to search only the left half of the tree 
    - if the target follows the root item, you need to search only the right subtree of the root node 
    - one comparison eliminates half the tree

- suppose you search the left half
    - means comparing the target with the item in the left child 
    - if the target precedes the left-child item, you need to search only the left half of its descendants, and so on 
    - each comparison cuts the number of potential matches in half 

- binary search tree combines a linked structure with binary search efficiency

Basic Ops 

- insert 

- search

- trees can be traversed in different ways because they are non-linear(inorder, preorder, postorder)

- in order traversal 
    - gives nodes in non-decreasing order 
        - traverse the left subtree in-order 
        - process the value in the node 
        - traverse the right subtree in-order 
    - the value in a node is not processed until the values in its left subtree are processed 
    - prints the node values in ascending order 

- preorder traversal 
    - used to create a copy of the tree 
    - the value in each node is processed as the node is visited 
    - the values in the left subtree are then processed 
    - then the values in the right subtree are processed 

- postorder traversal 
    - used to delete the tree the steps are 
        - traverse the left subtree post-order 
        - traverse the right subtree post-order 
        - then process the value in the node 
    - the value in each node is not processed until thevalues of its children are processed

- when inserting or searching for an element in a binary search tree 
    - the key of each visited node has to be compared with the key of the element to be inserted or found 

- the shape of the binary search tree depends entirely on the order of insertions and deletions, and can become degenerate 

- after a sequence of random insertion and deletion
    - the expected height of the tree approaches the square root of the number of keys (sqrt(n))
    - grows much faster than log n 

    - there has been alot to prevent degeneration of the tree resulting in worst case time complexity of O(n)
