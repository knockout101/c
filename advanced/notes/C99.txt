new features

- macros with a variable number of arguments

- C99 allows the use of sophisticated numbers (complex.h)
    - _Complex
        - used to declare complex floating type variables to store mathematical complex numbers
    - _Imaginary
        - declare imaginary floating type variables store mathematical imaginary numbers
    
- designated initializers
    - allow you to initialize the elements of an array, union, or struct explicitly by subscript or name

- restricted pointers
    - a type qualifier that can be used only for pointers

- new comment techniques
    - // comments

- inline functions
    - supplies a hint for the compiler to perform optimizations

- variable length arrays
    - arrays dimension has to be declared in C89
    - C99 permits declaration of array dimensions using integer variables or any valid integer expressions

- flexible array members
    - allows us to declare an array of unspecified length as the last member of a struct

- declaration of variables
    - it is now legal to declare variables it at any point of the program within the curly braces of main() function
    - very obvious in loops

- required in C89 (all variables be declared at the start of a block)
- new in C99 (varialbes can be declared anywhere)
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
