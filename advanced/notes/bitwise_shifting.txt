- C also has left-shift (<<) and right-shift (>>) operators 

- for each respective operator, vacated bits are set to 0 

- for the right-shift operator, the vacated bits are set to 0 if the value is unsigned 

<< - binary left shift operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified byt the right operand 
>> - binary right shift operator

undefined results

- if you shift a value to the left or right by an amount that is greater than or equal to the number of bits in the size of the data item you will get a undefined result 
    - on a machine that represents integers in 32 bits 
        - shifting an integer to the left or right by 32 or more bits is not guaranteed to produce a defined result in your program 

- also if you shift a value by a negative amount, the result is also undefined
