- gets function stands for get string and reads a line from standard input into a buffer 
    - reads until a terminating newline or EOF is found
    - takes one argument, a pointer to an array of chars where the string is stored 
    - returns str on success, and NULL on error or when end of file occurs 

char *gets(char *str)

- this function is deprecated and should never be used 
    - removed from C11 
    - two options instead (C99) are to use fgets() or getchar()

- Never Invoke the gets() function 
    - no check for buffer overflow is performed
    - it is impossible to tell without knowing the data in advance how many characters gets() will read
        - gets() will continue to store characters past the end of the buffer 

- fgets is used for reading entire lines of data from a file/stream (file get string)
    - has similar behavior to gets()
