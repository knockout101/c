/*
Goto statement Challenge

- write a program that uses goto statements to simulate a nested looping structure that prints a triangle of asterisks

- the output:

     *
    * *
   *   *
  *     *
 *********

 - the program should not utilize any looping constructs and instead only use the goto statement 

 - after writing the program, you should come to the conclusion that using a goto statement is terrible nad your code looks like spaghetti code
